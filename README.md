# WebGL-Running-Man
WebGL demonstration of a 3d figure running in a scene

## Setup
First, unzip the 'WebGL-Workspace' (sourced from https://github.com/matthew-e-brown/mv-redux , all credits to Matthew Brown)

If node and npm aren't already installed:

``install node``

``install npm``

Navigate to the workspace and run:

``npm install``

``npm run dev``

A browser tab should then open and you should be all set!
